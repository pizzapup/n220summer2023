    <h1>Lab 2 Exercises:</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Counter</h2>
      <p>Outputs a number to the console every draw call of P5</p>
      <p>
        <em style="color: red">click anywhere to start/stop the counter.</em>
      </p>
      <!-- Target container for p5 app "counterApp" -->
      <div id="counterApp"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Puck Side</h2>
      <p>
        Draws a circle where the mouse is. Circle is blue when mouse is on left
        side of canvas and red on the right side. Canvas is 400x300.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>World Wrap</h2>
      <p>
        Starts drawing ball on the left hand of the screen - make it move to the
        right 5px per frame. When the circle reaches 800pc to the right, the
        circle moves to the far left of the screen.
      </p>
      <!-- Target container for p5 app "worldWrapApp" -->
      <div id="worldWrapApp"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Ball Bounce</h2>
      <p>
        Create a sketch with a circle moving left and down at 5px per update.
        This speed should be stored as separate speed variables in your code
        (this is required to solve this problem). <br />Assume a 'world bounds'
        for this object to be 800x600 <br />When the ball reaches the edge of
        the bounds, bounce it by multiplying the associated velocity variable by
        *= -1, to make the ball be moving in the opposite direction. If you have
        found a hit on the right or left bounds, it should be the x velocity
        variable you are modifying. If its on the top or bottom bounds, you
        should be modifying the y velocity variable.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Ever larger, until not</h2>
      <p>
        Create an application that draws a circle to the center of the screen
        every update frame, starting with a diameter of 1. Using a global
        variable, change increase the diameter of the circle by 1 every frame.
        Once the circle gets a diameter of 200, set its diameter back to 1.
