    <h1>Click to Drop</h1>

      Build an application where, when a user clicks on the screen, a 'brick' is
      created at that x and y location, and falls down to the bottom of the
      screen at a speed of 5 pixels / frame. There can be multiple bricks in
      this application, so you will need to use two arrays and a loop to draw
      all of the bricks. Bricks will stack at bottom of canvas.
