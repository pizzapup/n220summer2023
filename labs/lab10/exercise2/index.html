    <h1>Color Mixer</h1>
    <div>
      This is an application that will start a div at a black color, and as a
      user presses buttons associated with RGB, the div will change to new
      colors. The button presses should affect additively - that is. If a div is
      currently blue, pressing +red buttons will change the div to a purple
      color.
      <br />
      9 buttons (associated with red green and blue). There should be a +1, +5,
      and +10 button for each color.
      <br />

      1 div that will change colors to the rgb color calculated
      <br />

      1 div that shows the current calculated rgb color
      <br />

      You must use attributes on the buttons for the values to change the colors
      by.
