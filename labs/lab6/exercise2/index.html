    <h1>Virtual Pet</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Create an application with an object that represent a virtual pet -
        similar to a Tamagotchi. Give this pet properties for name, energy,
        happiness, and age. Include two buttons (and functions) for feeding and
        playing with the pet - increasing the pet's energy by 5 when fed, and
        increasing its happiness by 5 when played with. Display these stats on
        the document: Name, happiness, and energy. They must update every time
        you change the properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider using a function to update the document so you are not
        repeating yourself across two functions.
