    <h2>Virtual Pet</h2>
    <p>
      Create an application with an object that represent a virtual pet -
      similar to a Tamagotchi. Give this pet properties for name, energy,
      happiness, and age. Include two buttons (and functions) for feeding and
      playing with the pet - increasing the pet's energy by 5 when fed, and
      increasing its happiness by 5 when played with. Display these stats on the
      document: Name, happiness, and energy. They must update every time you
      change the properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider using a function to update the document so you are not repeating
      yourself across two functions.
