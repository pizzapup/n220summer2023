    <h1>List Display</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Create an HTML5 application with a collection (array of objects) in
        JavaScript that with entries for something you have a collection of
        (movies, books, rocks, bugs.. what have you). Each object must have at
        least 3 properties. Use a loop in JavaScript to loop through those
        elements, and create a div for each that display the data, place that
        element on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Include in this loop at least one IF statement that changes an element's
        style based on some property. For instance, perhaps if a bug's length
        property is greater than 5cm, you set the background color of that
        element to yellow. Your data must be set up in a way to force this
        change to happen for at least one of your elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Dog List</h3>
      <p>
        Background color of the list item will be
        <span class="different-bg">#ecfffe</span> if the dog's size is large.
