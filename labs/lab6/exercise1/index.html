    <h1>Lab 6 | Objects</h1>
    <h2>List Display</h2>
    <p>
      Create an HTML5 application with a collection (array of objects) in
      JavaScript that with entries for something you have a collection of
      (movies, books, rocks, bugs.. what have you). Each object must have at
      least 3 properties. Use a loop in JavaScript to loop through those
      elements, and create a div for each that display the data, place that
      element on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Include in this loop at least one IF statement that changes an element's
      style based on some property. For instance, perhaps if a bug's length
      property is greater than 5cm, you set the background color of that element
      to yellow. Your data must be set up in a way to force this change to
      happen for at least one of your elements.
